Hi my name is Janette and I just wanted to drop you a quick note here instead of calling you. I came to your Hello world! | Consult Lawyers page and noticed you could have a lot more traffic. I have found that the key to running a successful website is making sure the visitors you are getting are interested in your niche. There is a company that you can get targeted visitors from and they let you try their service for free for 7 days. I managed to get over 300 targeted visitors to day to my website.
