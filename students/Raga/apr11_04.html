        After the encounter in the Seshachalam forests, practical steps have to be evolved. 
        The focus must be on prevention of smuggling which calls for a better strategy and must include the following:
        collection of data of the real smugglers and their networks which includes properties and vehicles; 
        surveillance of transport being used to drop off labour at the entry and exit points of the forests, 
        stock points of wood and crossing points; 
        a data base of all woodcutters previously arrested and their interrogation reports;
        training and equipping police and forest staff with proper weapons, night vision equipment and a public address system to warn cutters and smugglers before resorting to firing;
        making it mandatory for all red sanders sales to have a valid government permit with every transaction; identifying, in consultation with the Indian Navy, sea routes being used to smuggle the wood; counselling tribals on the risks involved in smuggling, and, finally, having a designated court to try all cases of smuggling on a fast-track basis.

I differ with the views in the Editorial and Mr. Vaikunth’s letter (both April 9), on the Tirupati encounter. There has been a one-sided presentation of the facts and no expression of empathy for forest officials, often caught between the police and smuggler gangs. The media in Andhra Pradesh reports that the Andhra Pradesh STF DIG told the Tamil Nadu police about the “shoot at sight orders” against red sanders smugglers having been approved by the State government and advising them to curb woodcutters from Tamil Nadu from entering the Seshachalam forests. But Tamil Nadu seems to have failed. Also, when woodcutters attack forest and police personnel, how do the police surround and arrest them, as Mr. Vaikunth says? A tonne of red sanders wood is valued at about Rs.1.5 crore, so one can imagine how much the country has been losing to smugglers.
