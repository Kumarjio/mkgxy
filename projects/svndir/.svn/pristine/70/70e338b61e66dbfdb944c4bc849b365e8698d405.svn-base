           <p>As you read these portfolios keep in mind the following points:</p>
           <ul>
            <li>Each faculty member will have a unique portfolio reflecting her or his unique contributions to education. The nine categories serve as a menu only. A candidate with educational contributions in 8 out of the 9 categories does not necessarily have a stronger case than someone with contributions in 4 out of the 9 categories.</li>
            <li>Unlike the CV, The typical portfolio is organized into projects rather than types of output. For example, if you are the director of a longitudinal theme, you would be advised to create a section corresponding to your longitudinal theme program. This section would begin with a brief description of the highlights of your program followed by supporting evidence that would include evaluations, peer reviews, outcomes, even publications. You might choose to flag this section with a tab if your portfolio is organized in a binder or create a separate electronic “page” if your Portfolio is on-line. In contrast, in your CV, all of these materials would be in separate sections. Think of the CV as a compilation of lists. Think of the Portfolio as a compilation of stories.</li>
            <li>The brief summary that begins each section is of roughly a page in length. Supportive material is relegated to appendices. Thus, the portfolio itself, stripped of its appendices, is usually only three to six pages long. A faculty member who spends most of her or his time at research may submit a portfolio of only one or two pages while career educators may require ten pages). A promotion and tenure committee member could read your educator’s portfolio in a few minutes. If she or he wanted to, they could jump to the appendix to verify a claim or obtain more details.</li>
